# Requirements for CVI AAC System (No Dlib Required)

# Core dependencies
opencv-python>=4.5.0
numpy>=1.19.0
pyttsx3>=2.90

# Optional: Only if you want GazeTracking (requires C++ compiler)
# dlib>=19.22.0
# gaze-tracking>=0.1.0

# Note: The CVI AAC system works perfectly with just Hough Circle tracking
# which uses only OpenCV (no dlib/C++ compiler needed)
